# waveparticles

A small Three.js learning project focused on creating a particle system using `BufferGeometry` and animating it as a wave over time.

The project explores how particle positions and colors are stored in buffer attributes and how updating those attributes each frame can be used to create wave-like motion.

## What this project does

- Creates a particle system using `THREE.BufferGeometry`
- Manually fills position and color buffers (`Float32Array`)
- Renders particles using `THREE.Points`
- Animates the particles vertically using a sine wave based on time and position
- Uses additive blending and textures to enhance visual appearance

## Core concepts

### Particle creation

Particles are generated by manually filling buffer attributes:

- `position` → stores particle positions as `(x, y, z)`
- `color` → stores per-particle RGB values

Each particle uses 3 consecutive values in the buffer arrays.

### Wave animation

During the animation loop, each particle’s Y position is updated using a sine function:

y = Math.sin(elapsedTime * speed + x * frequency) * amplitude
This makes the wave depend on both time and spatial position, resulting in a continuous wave motion rather than independent oscillations.
